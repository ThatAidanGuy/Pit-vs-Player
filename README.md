# Pit-vs-Player
A repository of files for the Pit vs Player construct game. Public for now.

project.c3proj should be the main file, which I think should be openable in Construct.

The game is also saved as one file: ThePitAndThePlayer_Aloy5.c3p. This is a standalone file whereas everything else is part of one greater whole.
